## CS 242 Final Project: Spotify Sprinter Unity Game (UIUC SP18)

For our final project, we created a side scrolling platform game in Unity that integrated the Spotify API to change elements of gameplay based on data pulled from the player's currently playing music.

Spotify Authorization was run simultaneously on a separate server to generate appropriate OAuth codes. Server code can be found under "auth-server/authoriztion_code/app.js". Unity C# scripts are stored under the "Scripts" folder. See the Manual Test Plan for screenshots of the game in action.

Collaborators: Kate Milleker and Kevin Eicken
